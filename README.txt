  IDACompare_Setup.exe will register dependancies and install full source bundle.

Overview:

 IDACompare is a plugin for IDA which is designed to help you
 line up functions across two separate disassemblies. IDACompare
 also contains a signature scanner, where you can save known functions
 and then scan new disassemblies against them looking for key functions.

 It has tools for sequentially renaming matched functions, as well as porting
 user specified names across disassemblies. 

 This plugin has been designed with Malcode analysis in mind. It should
 work equally well for patch analysis.  

 See readme.chm for more details
