 integrate compare UI with IDASrvr so right click
    rename functions
    decompile function
    jump to function
    if highlight sub receives null function, create new for constant bolding..

document nuances:
  p keypress in any listview on main form brings up profile function dialog
  you can drag and drop a mdb ontop the main form to load it, 
      (but only if you find a section of form not covered by a another control..)
